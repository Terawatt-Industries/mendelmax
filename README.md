##MendelMax 1.5 for LM8UU Bearings fulfilled by Terawatt Industries
This is the open-source MendelMax 1.5 kit fulfilled by Terawatt Industries.  Modifications include 8mm z-axis parts and Kuehling's x-ends, x-carriage, and so much more!

This repository contains the matching printed (plastic) parts for the MendelMax 1.5 printer for use with LM8UU bearings on all axes.  Many design files are STLs,
since the MendelMax 1.5 was originally designed in Alibre CAD - proprietary software.  However several of the Terawatt Industries modifications are available in SCAD and published on our Githubiverse site elsewhere - for example RAMPS mounts, extrusion clips, and z-top constraints.

NOTE:  SCADs for the x-ends are available at our Githubiverse page.
